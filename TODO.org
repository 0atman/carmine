* Docs
** README.md, TODO.org
** Generate Marginalia + link from README.
* API
** Organize commands
Go through entire command list:
*** Group by version compatibility (or functionality?)
Perhaps better to group by functionality (or even alphabetically!) and just
label commands that require very recent versions?
*** Clean-up args
*** Add missing commands
** Investigate fast byte reading/writing for deep-freeze, etc.
** Other response parsing possible & desireable?
** Pub/Sub reconnects support?
Waiting on Salvatore: https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/420
Recall that reconnects would also require re-establishing p/subscriptions.
** More helper fns?
* TESTS
** Update tests from accession, re-run. Check for regressions.
** Unit-test for sort* and Lua commands.
** More unit-tests, generally.
* MISC
** Push to GitHub, Clojars.
** Bench vs clj-redis, accession, redis-clojure, Jedis, redis-cli.
